# Tibia Low Framerate (TLF)
Tibia Low Framerate or TLF is a tool to decrease the fps of Tibia clients below the official limit

## Disclaimer
This application is not intended to be used on dynamic botting sessions but rather simple tasks like training or making runes. For these tasks it can be used completely AFK.

## F.A.Q.
### What's the problem?
As you may already know Tibia doesn't allow us to go below 10 FPS which is *really annoying* if you run several clients [Alternative Client Solutions](http://forums.xenobot.net/showthread.php?19129-Alternative-Multiclient-Solution).

### What's the solution?
Xenobot is a bot for Tibia that does everything without the need of graphics. Therefore, TLF or Tibia Low Framerate allows you to set all supported versions of Tibia with a custom amount of FPS between 1 and 100 and run as many clients as you want.

### Does this application modify the client?
Yes, it overwrites the value set in the memory of the supported Tibia client with the custom FPS. Therefore, *if you believe it makes you get a ban, DO NOT USE IT*.

### Is this the same that Neobot used?
I wouldn't be able to tell if Neobot used this technique when the client was being minimized but it is not detectable AFAIK.

### How much CPU usage should I have after using TLF?
It depends mostly on the scripts you are running with Xenobot but with graphics at 1 FPS the CPU usage fluctuates between 0 and 5%.

### Supported versions
* Tibia 9.0 to Tibia 10.76

### Unsupported versions
* Tibia 9.52
* Tibia 9.71
